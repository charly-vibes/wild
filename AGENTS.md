## Specodelic — spec format rules (managed block)

This repo's `specs/`-style markdown spec files (YAML frontmatter +
fixed-schema tables) are linted by `spk` (crates.io: specodelic).
Write specs so `spk lint` passes; embedded format revision: specodelic.md Revision 18

### Lint rules (every violation names its `rule_id`)

- `linter.frontmatter_valid` — frontmatter `kind` must be `intent` — the only top-level intent kind
- `linter.id_matches_file` — frontmatter `id` must equal the filename stem with `-` mapped to `.` (`_` is literal); a `spec.md` file derives its expected id from its parent directory (Revision 18)
- `linter.unique_id` — every row id in a file must be unique across all of the file's tables
- `linter.guard_required` — every transition must carry a non-null guard (a guard may be prose, or cite an invariant Constraint or a State — target typing is `ref_kind_compatible`'s beat)
- `linter.model_present` — the Model section must contain both a States list and a Transitions table (empty-but-present beats absent)
- `linter.ears_syntax` — the intent statement must contain an imperative `SHALL` and match one of the five EARS patterns
- `linter.no_conjoined_id` — an id must not encode two capabilities joined by `and`/`or`
- `linter.no_universal_in_id` — an id must not contain a universal token (all/every/any/always/never)
- `linter.total_refs` — every structured-field [[link]] must resolve to a definition somewhere in the corpus (Revision 18: all files resolve corpus-wide — the former `id: spec` self-containment retired)
- `linter.coverage` — every constraint must have a deriving property (`∃ property.derives_from == <constraint>`)
- `linter.no_orphan_property` — every property must derive from at least one constraint
- `linter.law_cases` — every law-kind property must enumerate its required cases as **name:** labels in its own predicate — the identity and associativity floor is mandatory, extra named cases are checkable declarations
- `linter.requirement_drift` — a dual-format file's ## Requirements mirror must hold every delta requirement (ADDED and MODIFIED sections alike) with identical requirement text, compared per requirement so mixed-delta files are satisfiable (blank lines and trailing space ignored)
- `linter.dual_format_valid` — a file carrying `## ADDED Requirements` must be a dual-format file — pair it with a sibling `## Requirements` section (Revision 18: the id is the naming law's business, not this rule's)
- `linter.terminal_states_emit` — every failure terminal state must emit exactly one file-owned effect Constraint — a mute failure terminal is a finding (specs/linter-failure_shape.md; timed_out/exploration_only are the stated v1 non-goal)
- `linter.error_labels_unique` — within one file, no two error Constraints may share a variant head — the label is file-id-namespaced (errors.md error_expr_shape), so collisions are a per-file property
- `linter.guard_negation_total` — every failure transition must cite exactly the union of its success siblings' citation sets, or be on the recorded carve-out list (orchestrate.md's stage-fail transitions) — a zero-citation failure guard off the list is a finding
- `linter.every_state_used` — every declared state must appear as from or to in at least one transition — a state no transition reaches is machinery the model can never enter or leave
- `linter.every_transition_valid` — every transition's from and to must name states declared in the same file's States section
- `linter.no_self_ref` — a row must not reference itself via traces_to or derives_from — a self-tracing row has no owning purpose
- `linter.acyclic` — the directed graph formed by constraint-traces_to ∪ property-derives_from ∪ guard-as-edge must contain no cycle (derives_from edges are property-sourced — the Reference Typing Appears-on column is normative, so a Constraint-row derives_from is typing's beat, never an edge)
- `linter.single_root_reachable` — every constraint/property/state/transition row must reach its file's OWN intent row through own-file primary linkage (traces_to/derives_from chains resolved within the file, plus the model's own from/to/guard/emits edges) — cross-file typed edges (guard citations of foreign constraints, satisfies, observes) are outbound leaves, never reachability paths; tiered: cross-file-only rows warn (advisory, exit 0), rows with no path to ANY intent hard-fail
- `linter.observability` — every effect Constraint must be the target of ≥1 `observes` reference from a different row — advisory: warned on the warnings channel (exit 0), never a failure
- `linter.checklist_well_formed` — a declared checklist manifest (`*.checklist.md`) must be a flat item list with stable ids plus a mapping table with exactly item/status/mapped_ids/rationale columns — a manifest the linter cannot read is a checklist going silently unconsulted
- `linter.every_item_accounted` — every checklist item must have exactly one mapping row with status `covered` or `waived` — an unconsulted item is the failure this checker exists to prevent
- `linter.covered_maps_resolve` — a `covered` mapping row must name a non-empty mapped_ids list whose ids resolve to real constraint or property rows — a claim resting on nothing is not a claim
- `linter.waiver_has_rationale` — a `waived` mapping row must carry non-empty rationale prose — an unexplained waiver is an unconsulted item with extra steps
- `linter.no_duplicate_claim` — no two mapping rows may target the same checklist item — one claim per item, on the record
- `linter.constraint_kind_closed` — every Constraint row's kind must be in {invariant, advisory, effect, extension_point} — an unreadable kind cell is outside the closed set (specs/linter-schema_shape.md)
- `linter.property_kind_closed` — every Property row's kind must be in {unit, law} — an unreadable kind cell is outside the closed set (specs/linter-schema_shape.md)
- `linter.pack_shape` — a kind: profile pack file's manifest must carry all six facet tables (Sections/Kinds/References/Checkers/Floors/Requires) with well-formed two-column rows, its Kinds rows must be pack-qualified (never a base closed-set name — the narrowing rejection), and manifest tables may not appear on non-profile files (specs/packs.md, Revision 14)
- `linter.orphan_vocabulary` — orphan vocabulary is a labeled failure naming the candidate pack and both remediations (enable/declare the pack, or fix the vocabulary) — a declared uses edge targeting an id no discovered kind: profile pack carries, or a pack-qualified token used in a kind/field position with no discovered pack in its namespace (candidate prefix-derived when only the namespace is known) (specs/packs.md, Revision 14)
- `linter.skew_advisory` — a declared pack's Requires base pin older than the workspace corpus revision is a warnings-channel advisory naming the pack's base pin and the corpus revision — never silent, never failing (specs/packs.md, Revision 14)
- `linter.schema_matches_typing_table` — when the lint target carries the format doc, its Reference Typing table must equal the Schema value row for row — the document and the code cannot drift; a corpus without the format doc is out of the gate's scope (no-op, never fabricated expected rows) (add-acset-core, linter-schema_shape family)

### Commands

- `spk lint <dir>` — check the invariants (fails with a hint on zero files)
- `spk graph <dir>` — typed reference graph (state edges, typing
  violations, supersedes cycles; blast-radius lands later)
- `spk compile <files>` — emit TOML / proptest / TLA+ artifacts
- `spk model-check <files>` — run the model checker against compiled
  output (stateright; reports land as `*.check.json`)
- `spk explain [topic]` — the embedded format primer (works offline)
- `spk doctor` — diagnose workspace + block currency
- `spk feedback bug --dry-run` — file an issue against upstream

Refresh this block after upgrading: `spk init --force`.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY.
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.
